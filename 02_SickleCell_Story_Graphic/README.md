# 🩺 Sickle Cell Patient Story — A Visual Narrative  
*A storytelling graphic created to humanize a condition often spoken about only in clinical terms.*

---

## 🌿 Project Overview

This project tells the story of **Ayo**, a young sickle cell carrier whose life is shaped by more than medical symptoms.  
Through narrative design and visual storytelling, this piece highlights the emotional, social, and psychological realities that often remain unseen.

Instead of presenting sickle cell strictly as a medical diagnosis, this project focuses on the **lived experience** — the fear families face, the stigma from peers, the fatigue Ayo carries, and the silent weight shouldered by caregivers.

The goal is simple but intentional:  
**to use visual storytelling to build empathy and understanding.**

Designed entirely in **Canva**, this multi-panel narrative blends character illustrations, thematic colors, and data elements to create a compassionate portrayal of life with sickle cell disease.

## 💬 Personal Reflection

Creating this visualization required approaching the topic with sensitivity and intention.  
It reminded me that while data can inform us, **stories help us feel**.  
This piece is a small step toward giving visibility to the emotional and social burdens carried by sickle cell patients and those who love them.
