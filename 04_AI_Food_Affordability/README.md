# 🍎 AI & Food Affordability — A Data Storytelling Video  
*A visual narrative exploring how the implementation of artificial intelligence in the agricultural sector impacts food prices, supply chains, and post-pandemic realities.using COVID19 as a benchmark*

## 🌾 Project Overview  

This project is a **video-based data story** examining how the rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture affects **food affordability**, especially in the years following COVID-19.  

Instead of relying solely on charts or static visuals, this project uses **scrollytelling**, animation, and narrative sequencing to show how food prices shifted:

- *before COVID*  
- *during global supply chain disruptions*  
- *after the accelerated adoption of AI-driven tools in agriculture*  

It pushes the viewer to consider an important question:  

### **If AI makes production more efficient, why didn’t food become more affordable?**

## 🤖 Why AI? Why Food Affordability?

During COVID-19:

- labour shortages  
- transportation delays  
- supply chain instability  
- rising production costs  

forced agricultural systems to adopt new technologies — including AI — much faster than expected.

AI promised:

- efficiency,  
- automation,  
- lower losses,  
- and faster supply movement.  

But at the consumer level, **prices stayed high**, raising questions about equity, access, and who truly benefits from technological advancements.

## 🎬 Why a Video Format?

Some stories need movement, pacing, and emotional buildup.  
A video format allowed me to:

- create **smooth narrative transitions**,  
- contrast pre- and post-COVID realities,  
- embed **storytelling and emotion**,  
- and visually mirror the real-life experience of watching prices climb over time.  

This format turns analysis into a **story people can feel**, not just observe.

## 📊 Data & Analytical Approach  

The analysis behind this story involved:

- exploring monthly retail food price data  
- identifying pre- vs post-COVID inflation patterns  
- examining AI-related agricultural interventions  
- comparing AI adoption timelines with price volatility  
- mapping affordability trends across food categories  

The notebook (`FoodAffordability.ipynb`) contains the detailed exploratory analysis.

The raw dataset (`MonthlyRetailPrices.xls`) is also included in this folder for transparency and reproducibility.

## 🎤 My Role

I contributed to the project through:

- Data analysis & insight extraction  
- Storyboarding the narrative flow  
- Designing and animating scenes  
- Writing the voiceover script  
- Editing the full video  
- Creating the final scrollytelling experience  

This project combines **analytics**, **visual storytelling**, and **design thinking** — showing how data can be used to craft meaningful, human-centered stories.

## 💬 Reflection

Working on this project emphasized how deeply economics, technology, and lived experience are intertwined.  
Even when AI improves production efficiency, **affordability is shaped by much more than technology**.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in:

- narrative visualization  
- ethical data communication  
- connecting quantitative findings to human realities  

Data becomes most powerful when it’s transformed into a story that helps people see the world differently.
