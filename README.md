# 📊 Data Visualization Portfolio  
*A curated collection of analytical storytelling, scrollytelling, dashboards, and creative data-driven visuals.*

Welcome to my Data Visualization Portfolio — a showcase of work that blends **data**, **design**, and **storytelling** across multiple tools such as Excel, Python, Canva, and Flourish.  
Each project highlights a different dimension of my visualization approach:  
from historical redesigns to animated scrollytelling, infographics, and Excel dashboards.

This repository includes projects such as:

- 🗺️ A modern redesign of **John Snow’s 1854 Cholera Map** (Flourish storymap)  
- 📉 A pricing and innovation analysis on **AI and food affordability**  
- ♀️ A sociological infographic on **Gender Inequality in Canada**  
- 💭 A narrative-driven **Sickle Cell patient story visualization**  
- 📚 Multiple storytelling sketches and supporting design assets
